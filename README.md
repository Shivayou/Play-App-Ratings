This data science project walks through step by step process of how I predicted the ratings of apps on Google play. It consist of building models using sklearn and random forest regression using a dataset from Udemy. Some of the frameworks and tools used here are-

1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Google colab
